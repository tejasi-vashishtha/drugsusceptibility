Executive Summary:
In this day and age, when accessibility to drugs has increased manifolds, vast sections of the
population have become susceptible to drug abuse. Consequently, a lot needs to be done to
help healthcare organizations combat this problem. There is a plethora of factors that demand
consideration when determining whether an individual has the tendency towards drug
addiction. In our system, we attempt to provide a framework for healthcare/social workers to
begin working with and build upon. We propose to find patterns in population data to put a
face to the kind of profile that is vulnerable to fall prey to drug abuse. By studying and
employing various methods of data analysis, we will help organizations identify target groups
to focus their efforts on.
